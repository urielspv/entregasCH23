Exercise #2
Take the blog post you have been building on Introduction to Bootstrap Exercise #1.

Add in the ability to use Javascript on the page and create a new .js file.

In two sections of your blog, add in a button. When the buttons are clicked, an alert should show. In the alert, add in text that is relevant to the section where your button is located (i.e. if it's a section about your hometown, add a fun fact about where you're from). */
